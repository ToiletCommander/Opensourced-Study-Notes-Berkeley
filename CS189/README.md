# CS189

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)
> Additional Note: The credit of most of those notes are due to the instructor (Prof. Johnathan Shewchuk) and TAs of this course. A great thank you for them for making this course so enjoyable!

# EECS16B

Those are note archives as well as very well-structured final review docs I made for my self. I put it here so that you can study it and also I will be able to review it later. So if you found this useful, make sure you star my [repo](https://github.com/ToiletCommander/Opensourced-Study-Notes-Berkeley)

## Resource List

- [Final Cheatsheet](Annotated/20211214%20Final%20Cheatsheet.pdf)
  - Something to complain about: Before I took my CS70 final the calnet login service crashed because of a connection issue to Duo Mobile Servers so I wasn't able to print this out and I had to take the CS70 Final exam with nothing but my CS61C scratch paper. I am still happy that I got 1 SD above the mean though.
